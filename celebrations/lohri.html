    <p><em>A Festival of Fire, Harvest, and Punjabi Folk Joy</em></p>

  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Lohri is a vibrant Punjabi folk festival celebrated every year on
      <strong>13 January</strong>.
      It marks the end of the harsh winter and the beginning of longer days
      as the Sun begins its northward journey (<em>Uttarayan</em>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Closely connected with agriculture, Lohri is a celebration of gratitude
      for a successful harvest, especially the <strong>Rabi crops</strong>
      such as wheat and sugarcane.
      The festival is deeply rooted in rural life, community bonding,
      and joyful expression.

    <p>
      The heart of Lohri celebrations is the community bonfire lit at sunset.
      Families and neighbours gather around the fire
      and perform <strong>Parikrama</strong> (circumambulation),
      offering prayers to <strong>Agni</strong>, the Fire God.
    </p>

    <p>
      Offerings such as sesame seeds, jaggery, peanuts, popcorn,
      gajak, and rewri are tossed into the flames
      as a gesture of thanksgiving and hope for prosperity.

    <h4>Dulla Bhatti – The Folk Hero</h4>

      Most Lohri songs revolve around <strong>Dulla Bhatti</strong>,
      a legendary 16th-century Punjabi folk hero,
      often described as the “Robin Hood of Punjab”.

    <p>
      He is remembered for rescuing girls from slavery
      and arranging their marriages.
      The popular song <em>“Sundar Mundriye”</em>
      is sung in his honour during Lohri celebrations.
