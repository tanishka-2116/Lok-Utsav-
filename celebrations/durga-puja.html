  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Durga Puja is the most important and widely celebrated festival
      of the Bengali community.
      It commemorates the victory of
      <strong>Goddess Durga</strong>
      over the buffalo demon <strong>Mahishasura</strong>,
      symbolizing the triumph of good over evil.
    </p>

    <p>
      More than a religious observance,
      Durga Puja is a massive cultural phenomenon
      marked by elaborate <strong>pandals</strong>,
      artistic idol-making,
      music, dance, food, and a unique
      <strong>“Sarbojonin”</strong> spirit —
      a celebration meant for everyone.

  <!-- DEEP MEANING -->
  <section>
    <h3>The Deeper Meaning of Durga Puja</h3>

    <p>
      Goddess Durga represents <strong>Shakti</strong>,
      the divine feminine energy that protects the universe
      from chaos and injustice.
      Her battle with Mahishasura symbolizes
      the eternal struggle between righteousness and ego.
    </p>

    <p>
      Durga Puja teaches that evil is not destroyed by brute force alone,
      but through courage, wisdom, discipline, and unity.
      The festival also celebrates womanhood, strength,
      and moral responsibility.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- STORY -->
  <section>
    <h3>A Sacred Story from the Scriptures</h3>

    <p>
      According to the <strong>Devi Mahatmya</strong>,
      Mahishasura received a boon that he could not be killed
      by any man or god.
      Drunk with power, he began terrorizing heaven and earth.
    </p>

    <p>
      The gods combined their energies to create Goddess Durga,
      who rode a lion and wielded divine weapons.
      After a fierce battle lasting nine nights,
      Durga slew Mahishasura at the moment of
      <strong>Sandhi</strong> —
      the sacred junction of Ashtami and Navami.
    </p>

    <p>
      This moment is worshipped as <strong>Sandhi Puja</strong>,
      one of the most powerful rituals of the festival.
