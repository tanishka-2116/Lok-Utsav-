  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Rath Yatra, also known as the <strong>Festival of Chariots</strong>,
      is one of the most iconic and globally recognized Hindu festivals.
      Celebrated annually in <strong>Puri, Odisha</strong>,
      it marks the grand procession of
      <strong>Lord Jagannath</strong>,
      along with his elder brother
      <strong>Lord Balabhadra</strong>
      and sister <strong>Goddess Subhadra</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      During this festival, the deities travel from the
      <strong>Jagannath Temple</strong>
      to the <strong>Gundicha Temple</strong>,
      believed to be their maternal aunt’s home.
      In 2026, the main Rath Yatra begins on
      <strong>Thursday, 16 July</strong>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ORIGIN & HISTORY -->
  <section>
    <h3>Historical and Scriptural Background</h3>

    <p>
      Rath Yatra finds mention in ancient scriptures
      such as the <strong>Skanda Purana</strong>,
      <strong>Brahma Purana</strong>,
      and <strong>Padma Purana</strong>.
      Lord Jagannath is worshipped as a form of
      <strong>Lord Vishnu / Krishna</strong>,
      representing the universal Lord who belongs to all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike most temple rituals where devotees
      go to the deity,
      Rath Yatra is unique because
      <strong>the Lord himself comes out to meet the people</strong>,
      symbolizing divine accessibility,
      compassion, and inclusiveness.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SPIRITUAL MEANING -->
  <section>
    <h3>Deeper Spiritual Significance</h3>

    <p>
      Spiritually, Rath Yatra represents
      the journey of the soul.
      The chariot symbolizes the human body,
      the reins represent the mind,
      and the wheels signify time and movement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pulling the chariot is considered an act of
      supreme devotion.
      It is believed that even touching the rope
      grants spiritual merit
      and liberation from past karmas.
    </p>

  <!-- THE THREE CHARIOTS -->
  <section>
    <h3>The Three Sacred Chariots</h3>

    <p>
      Every year, three massive chariots are
      constructed from scratch using specific sacred wood,
      following age-old measurements and rituals.
      Not a single iron nail is used.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nandighosa:</strong> Chariot of Lord Jagannath</li>
      <li><strong>Taladhwaja:</strong> Chariot of Lord Balabhadra</li>
      <li><strong>Darpadalana:</strong> Chariot of Goddess Subhadra</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- RITUALS -->
  <section>
    <h3>Major Rituals of Rath Yatra</h3>

    <h4>Snana Purnima</h4>
    <p>
      Before Rath Yatra, the deities are bathed
      with <strong>108 pots of sacred water</strong>.
      After this ritual, the deities are believed
      to fall ill and remain in isolation
      (<em>Anavasara</em>) for about 15 days.
    </p>

    <h4>Chera Pahanra</h4>
    <p>
      The Gajapati King of Puri performs
      <strong>Chera Pahanra</strong>,
      where he sweeps the chariots with a golden broom.
      This ritual conveys a powerful message:
      <strong>before God, all are equal</strong>.
    </p>

    <h4>Gundicha Yatra</h4>
    <p>
      The journey to Gundicha Temple signifies
      a break from routine life,
      allowing the Lord to mingle freely with devotees.
      The return journey is known as
      <strong>Bahuda Yatra</strong>.
