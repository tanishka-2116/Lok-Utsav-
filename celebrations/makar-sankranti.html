  <!-- TITLE -->
  <section>
    <h2>Makar Sankranti</h2>
    <p><em>A Festival of the Sun, Harvest, and New Beginnings</em></p>
  </section>

  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Makar Sankranti is one of the most important harvest festivals of India.
      It marks the transition of the Sun into the zodiac sign of
      <strong>Makara (Capricorn)</strong>.
      Unlike most Hindu festivals, which are based on the lunar calendar,
      Makar Sankranti follows the <strong>solar cycle</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because of this, the festival usually falls on
      <strong>14 January</strong> every year
      (and occasionally on 15 January during leap years).
      It signals the end of winter and the beginning of longer, warmer days.
    </p>

  <!-- SIGNIFICANCE -->
  <section>
    <h3>Key Significance of Makar Sankranti</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Solar Transition:</strong>
        The Sun begins its northward journey, known as <em>Uttarayan</em>,
        which is considered an auspicious phase in Hindu tradition.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Harvest Celebration:</strong>
        Farmers celebrate the completion of the harvest season
        and express gratitude to nature and the Sun God (Surya).
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Spiritual Renewal:</strong>
        Many devotees take holy dips in rivers such as the Ganga,
        Yamuna, Godavari, and Kaveri to purify the body and soul.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- UTTARAYAN -->
  <section>
    <h3>Uttarayan – The Northward Journey of the Sun</h3>

    <p>
      Makar Sankranti marks the beginning of Uttarayan,
      the six-month period when the Sun moves northward.
      In Hindu belief, this phase represents light, knowledge,
      positivity, and spiritual growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many sacred events, pilgrimages, and rituals are considered
      especially beneficial during this period.
      The transition from Dakshinayan (southern movement) to Uttarayan
      symbolizes moving from darkness toward light.
