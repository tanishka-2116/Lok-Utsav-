    <p><em>The Sacred Night of Shiva–Parvati Vivah</em></p>
  </section>

  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Mahashivratri, meaning <strong>“The Great Night of Shiva”</strong>,
      is one of the most sacred festivals in Hindu tradition.
      It is primarily celebrated as the
      <strong>divine marriage of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati</strong>,
      symbolizing the union of
      <strong>consciousness (Shiva)</strong>
      and <strong>energy (Shakti)</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The festival is observed on the
      <strong>14th night of the waning moon</strong>
      in the month of <em>Phalguna</em>.
      In 2026, Mahashivratri falls on
      <strong>Sunday, 15 February</strong>,
      with the most auspicious
      <strong>Nishita Kaal Puja</strong>
      from <strong>11:55 PM to 12:56 AM</strong>.
    </p>

  <!-- CORE STORY -->
  <section>
    <h3>The Story of Shiva and Parvati’s Marriage</h3>

    <p>
      According to the <strong>Shiva Purana</strong> and
      <strong>Skanda Purana</strong>,
      Goddess Parvati undertook severe penance
      to win Lord Shiva as her husband.
      Shiva, the supreme ascetic,
      was immersed in deep meditation,
      detached from worldly life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Parvati’s unwavering devotion,
      discipline, and purity
      ultimately moved Shiva.
      Their marriage on Mahashivratri
      represents the balance of
      renunciation and responsibility,
      stillness and movement,
      wisdom and love.
    </p>

    <p>
      This sacred union is celebrated across India,
      especially by married women and young girls,
      who pray for marital harmony,
      inner strength, and spiritual growth.
    </p>

  <!-- DEEP MEANING -->
  <section>
    <h3>The Deeper Spiritual Meaning</h3>

    <p>
      Mahashivratri is not merely about rituals,
      but about aligning one’s inner energies.
      Shiva represents pure awareness,
      while Parvati represents dynamic power.
      Their union signifies the completion of life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Spiritually, this night is considered powerful
      because natural planetary positions
      are believed to support the upward movement
      of energy within the human body.
      This is why staying awake
      (<strong>Jagran</strong>)
      with awareness is emphasized.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- OTHER BELIEFS -->
  <section>
    <h3>Other Sacred Beliefs Associated with Mahashivratri</h3>

    <p>
      While Shiva–Parvati Vivah is the primary belief,
      scriptures also associate Mahashivratri
      with other profound events.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Samudra Manthan:</strong>
        Shiva consumed the deadly poison Halahala
        to save the universe, earning the name Neelkanth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Shiva Linga Manifestation:</strong>
        Some traditions believe Shiva revealed himself
        as the infinite Jyotirlinga on this night.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These interpretations do not contradict each other,
      but together reflect Shiva’s role
      as protector, ascetic, and cosmic balance.
