  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Puthandu, also known as <strong>Tamil Puthandu</strong>,
      is the traditional New Year festival
      of the Tamil people.
      It is celebrated on the first day of the
      Tamil month <strong>Chithirai</strong>,
      usually falling in mid-April.
    </p>

    <p>
      The word <strong>“Puthandu”</strong>
      means <em>“new year”</em>,
      symbolising fresh beginnings,
      hope, gratitude, and reflection.
      The festival aligns with the Sun’s entry
      into the zodiac sign of Aries (Mesha).
    </p>

  <!-- MYTHOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE -->
  <section>
    <h3>Mythological and Cultural Significance</h3>

    <p>
      According to Tamil tradition,
      Puthandu is associated with
      <strong>Lord Brahma</strong>,
      the creator of the universe.
      It is believed that creation began on this day,
      making it a cosmic new beginning.
    </p>

    <p>
      The festival also marks the start
      of a new agricultural and solar cycle,
      reflecting ancient Tamil knowledge
      of astronomy, timekeeping, and nature.

    <h3>Puthandu Kani – The Auspicious First Sight</h3>

    <p>
      Similar to Vishu,
      the first sight of the year
      (<strong>Kani</strong>) holds great importance.
      Families arrange auspicious items
      on the previous night
      so they are the first thing seen
      on Puthandu morning.
    </p>

    <h4>Items in Puthandu Kani</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Mirror (self-awareness and truth)</li>

  <!-- PANCHANGA -->
  <section>
    <h3>Panchanga Reading (Panchanga Vaachanam)</h3>

    <p>
      One of the most important rituals of Puthandu
      is the reading of the <strong>Tamil Panchangam</strong>,
      which outlines astrological predictions
      for the coming year.
    </p>

    <p>
      Elders or priests read the Panchangam
      aloud to the family,
      helping people prepare mentally
      and spiritually for the year ahead.
