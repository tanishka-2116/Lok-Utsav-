    <p><em>The Great Night of Lord Shiva</em></p>
  </section>

  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Mahashivratri, meaning <strong>“The Great Night of Shiva”</strong>,
      is one of the most sacred festivals dedicated to
      <strong>Lord Shiva</strong>,
      the supreme yogi and destroyer of ignorance.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is observed on the <strong>14th night of the waning moon</strong>
      in the Hindu month of <em>Phalguna</em>.
      In 2026, Mahashivratri falls on
      <strong>Sunday, 15 February</strong>,
      with the most auspicious
      <strong>Nishita Kaal Puja</strong>
      occurring from <strong>11:55 PM to 12:56 AM</strong>.
    </p>

  <!-- DEEP UNDERSTANDING -->
  <section>
    <h3>The Deeper Meaning of Mahashivratri</h3>

    <p>
      Mahashivratri is not merely a festival,
      but a night of <strong>inner awakening</strong>.
      It symbolizes the overcoming of darkness and ignorance
      through awareness, discipline, and devotion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Spiritually, this night is considered powerful
      because the planetary positions are believed
      to naturally raise the energy in the human spine.
      Staying awake (Jagran) with an upright posture
      helps seekers move towards higher consciousness.
    </p>

  <!-- SHORT STORY -->
  <section>
    <h3>A Sacred Story from Hindu Scriptures</h3>

    <p>
      One ancient legend associated with Mahashivratri
      comes from the <strong>Shiva Purana</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the cosmic event of <strong>Samudra Manthan</strong>
      (the churning of the ocean),
      a deadly poison called <em>Halahala</em> emerged,
      threatening to destroy the entire universe.
      Neither gods nor demons could contain it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lord Shiva, out of compassion for all creation,
      consumed the poison to save the world.
      Goddess Parvati held his throat to stop the poison
      from spreading, turning it blue.
      Thus, Shiva came to be known as <strong>Neelkanth</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mahashivratri is believed to be the night
      when Shiva performed this supreme act of sacrifice,
      reminding humanity that true divinity lies
      in selflessness and protection of life.
    </p>

  <!-- RITUALS -->
  <section>
    <h3>Key Rituals and Practices</h3>

    <h4>Abhishek of Shiva Linga</h4>
    <p>
      Devotees perform <strong>Abhishek</strong>
      by bathing the Shiva Linga with water,
      milk, honey, and Panchamrit.
      This ritual symbolizes cooling Shiva’s intense energy
      and cleansing the devotee’s inner self.
    </p>

    <h4>Jagran (Night Vigil)</h4>
    <p>
      Staying awake all night while chanting,
      meditating, or singing bhajans
      is a central practice.
      Chanting <em>“Om Namah Shivaya”</em>
      is believed to purify the mind and soul.
    </p>

    <h4>Divine Marriage of Shiva and Parvati</h4>
    <p>
      Mahashivratri also commemorates
      the sacred marriage of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati,
      symbolizing the union of
      <strong>consciousness (Shiva)</strong>
      and <strong>energy (Shakti)</strong>.
