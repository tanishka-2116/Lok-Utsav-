      Janmashtami, also known as <strong>Gokulashtami</strong>,
      celebrates the birth of <strong>Lord Krishna</strong>,

      The festival commemorates the divine appearance of Krishna,
      who came to restore dharma and protect humanity from evil.

  <!-- SIGNIFICANCE -->
  <section>
    <h3>Spiritual and Cultural Significance</h3>

    <p>
      Janmashtami symbolizes the triumph of good over evil,
      love over fear, and devotion over ego.
      Lord Krishna’s life teachings —
      love, compassion, duty, and wisdom —
      continue to guide millions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The festival is celebrated with fasting, prayer,
      singing devotional songs, storytelling,
      and joyful community gatherings.
    </p>

  <!-- RITUALS -->
  <section>
    <h3>Key Rituals and Traditions</h3>

    <h4>Nishita Puja (Midnight Worship)</h4>
    <p>
      The most sacred ritual of Janmashtami is
      <strong>Nishita Puja</strong>,
      performed at midnight —
      the time when Lord Krishna is believed to have been born.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idol of baby Krishna is bathed in milk,
      curd, honey, ghee, and water
      (<em>Abhishek</em>)
      and then placed in a decorated cradle or swing
      known as <strong>Jhulan</strong>.
    </p>

    <h4>Dahi Handi</h4>
    <p>
      Especially popular in Maharashtra,
      <strong>Dahi Handi</strong>
      recreates Krishna’s childhood love for butter.
      Teams called <strong>Govindas</strong>
      form human pyramids to break a clay pot
      filled with curd, butter, and prizes,
      hung high above the ground.
    </p>

    <h4>Raas Leela</h4>
    <p>
      In North India, particularly in Mathura and Vrindavan,
      <strong>Raas Leela</strong>
      performances depict episodes from Krishna’s life,
      including his divine dance with the Gopis.
    </p>

    <h4>Symbolic Footprints</h4>
    <p>
      In many South Indian homes,
      tiny footprints of Krishna are drawn
      using rice paste from the entrance to the puja room,
      symbolizing the Lord’s arrival into the household.
