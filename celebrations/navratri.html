  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Navratri, meaning <strong>“nine nights”</strong>, is a major Hindu festival
      dedicated to the worship of Goddess Durga and her nine divine forms,
      collectively known as the <strong>Navadurga</strong>.
      It celebrates the victory of good over evil,
      symbolizing the triumph of Goddess Durga over the buffalo demon Mahishasura.
    </p>

    <p>
      Navratri is not just a religious observance but a deeply cultural
      and social celebration that honours <strong>Shakti</strong> —
      the divine feminine energy responsible for creation,
      preservation, and transformation in the universe.
    </p>

        <strong>Days 4–6:</strong> Worship of Goddess Lakshmi —
        symbolizing prosperity, balance, and abundance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Days 7–9:</strong> Worship of Goddess Saraswati —
        representing knowledge, wisdom, and spiritual insight.
