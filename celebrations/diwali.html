    <p><em>The Festival of Lights, Hope, and Togetherness</em></p>
  </section>

  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the most important and widely
      celebrated festivals in India. The word “Deepavali” comes from two Sanskrit
      words — <strong>Deepa</strong> meaning lamp or light, and <strong>Avali</strong>
      meaning a row or series. Together, Deepavali means a “row of lights”.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diwali symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, good over evil,
      and knowledge over ignorance. It is a festival that brings families together,
      fills homes with warmth and joy, and inspires people to begin anew with hope
      and positivity.
    </p>

  <!-- WHEN & WHY -->
  <section>
    <h3>When and Why Diwali is Celebrated</h3>
    <p>
      Diwali is celebrated on the night of <strong>Amavasya</strong> (new moon day),
      usually in the months of October or November. The exact date changes every year
      because it is based on the lunar calendar.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Hindus, Diwali marks the return of Lord Rama, along with Sita and Lakshmana,
      to Ayodhya after a fourteen-year exile and the defeat of the demon king Ravana.
      People lit lamps to welcome their king, and this tradition continues even today.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diwali is also celebrated in many other countries such as Nepal, Sri Lanka,
      Myanmar, Mauritius, Singapore, Malaysia, Fiji, Guyana, Suriname,
      and Trinidad and Tobago, making it a global celebration of light and hope.

  <!-- FIVE DAYS -->
  <section>
    <h3>The Five Days of Diwali</h3>

    <h4>1. Dhanteras</h4>
    <p>
      Diwali celebrations begin with Dhanteras. On this day, people buy gold,
      silver, jewelry, utensils, or new household items as symbols of prosperity
      and good fortune. Homes are cleaned, and prayers are offered to seek blessings
      for health, wealth, and well-being.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Naraka Chaturdashi (Chhoti Diwali)</h4>
    <p>
      The second day is known as Naraka Chaturdashi or Chhoti Diwali.
      It marks the victory of Lord Krishna over the demon king Narakasura.
      This day symbolizes the removal of evil and negative energies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Traditionally, people wake up early, take ritual baths,
      decorate their homes with flowers and mango leaves,
      and light lamps. Bursting firecrackers is believed to drive away evil spirits.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Diwali – Lakshmi Puja (Main Day)</h4>
    <p>
      The third day is the main and most important day of Diwali.
      On this day, families worship Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity,
      and Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles and symbol of good fortune.
    </p>

    <p>
      Idols or images of Lakshmi and Ganesha are installed,
      diyas are lit, mantras are chanted, and offerings such as flowers,
      sweets, fruits, and coins are made. Families pray together
      and seek blessings for prosperity, wisdom, and happiness.
    </p>

    <h4>4. Govardhan Puja</h4>
    <p>
      The fourth day of Diwali is celebrated as Govardhan Puja.
      It commemorates the day Lord Krishna lifted the Govardhan mountain
      to protect people from heavy rains and floods.
    </p>

    <p>
      This day highlights gratitude toward nature and reminds people
      of the importance of protecting the environment.
    </p>

    <h4>5. Bhai Dooj</h4>
    <p>
      The fifth and final day of Diwali is Bhai Dooj.
      On this day, sisters pray for the long life and success of their brothers
      by performing a traditional tika ceremony.
      Brothers, in return, give gifts and promise to protect their sisters.
    </p>

  <!-- FOOD -->
  <section>
  <h3>Diwali Sweets and Festive Food</h3>

  <p>
    Food holds a very special place in Diwali celebrations,
    especially in Maharashtra, where the festival is incomplete
    without a traditional <strong>Diwali Faraal</strong> — a festive spread
    of sweets and savoury snacks prepared at home and shared with
    family, friends, and neighbours.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Diwali faraal reflects balance in life — sweetness and spice,
    richness and simplicity — and represents generosity, hospitality,
    and togetherness.
  </p>

  <h4>Traditional Maharashtrian Diwali Sweets</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Karanji</strong> – Deep-fried dumplings filled with roasted coconut,
      jaggery, poppy seeds, and dry fruits, crisp outside and rich inside.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Anarse</strong> – A traditional sweet made from fermented rice flour
      and jaggery, shallow-fried to a golden crisp and topped with poppy seeds.
      Anarse is considered one of the most skill-intensive Diwali sweets.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Chirote</strong> – A flaky, layered pastry deep-fried and dusted
      with powdered sugar, known for its delicate texture.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Ladoo (Laddoo)</strong> – Besan, rava (semolina), and coconut laddoos
      are staple Diwali sweets, simple to prepare yet deeply festive.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Shankarpali</strong> – Sweet, crispy diamond-shaped bites made
      using flour, sugar, and ghee, enjoyed across all age groups.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Kandi Pedha</strong> – A specialty sweet from Satara, known for its
      grainy texture and caramel-like flavour, often prepared during Diwali.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Gulab Jamun and Shrikhand</strong> – Popular dairy-based sweets
      commonly served during family gatherings and festive meals.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Guravali</strong> – A unique traditional sweet stuffed with coconut
      and delicately scented with jasmine buds, adding fragrance to the festive spread.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Savoury Items in the Diwali Faraal</h4>

  <p>
    To balance the sweetness, Diwali faraal always includes savoury snacks:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Chakli</strong> – Crunchy spiral snacks made from rice and lentil flour,
      seasoned with spices.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Poha Chivda</strong> – A light and flavourful flattened rice mixture
      with peanuts, curry leaves, and mild spices.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Preparing Diwali faraal is often a collective family activity,
    where recipes are passed down through generations.
    Sharing these sweets and snacks strengthens social bonds
    and turns Diwali into a celebration of warmth, generosity, and shared joy.

  <!-- SOCIAL MESSAGE -->
  <section>
    <h3>Social and Cultural Message of Diwali</h3>
    <p>
      Diwali teaches important values such as hope, gratitude, unity,
      and the triumph of good over evil. It encourages people to forgive,
      forget past grievances, and move forward with positivity.
    </p>

    <p>
      In modern times, Diwali also promotes responsible celebrations,
      environmental awareness, and the idea of celebrating with care
      for nature and society.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CONCLUSION -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Diwali is not just a festival of lights — it is a celebration of life itself.
      Through devotion, family gatherings, shared meals, and glowing lamps,
      Diwali reminds us that even in the darkest times,
      light and hope always find a way.
