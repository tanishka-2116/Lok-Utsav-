    <h3>The Two Days of Holi</h3>

    <h4>Holika Dahan (Chhoti Holi)</h4>
    <p>
      The night before Holi is marked by <strong>Holika Dahan</strong>,
      a ceremonial bonfire symbolizing the burning of evil.
      Families gather around the fire, sing, pray,
      and offer grains or coconuts.

    <p>
      This ritual is rooted in the legend of Prahlada and Holika,
      representing the protection of devotion and righteousness.
    </p>

  <!-- LEGENDS -->
  <section>
    <h3>Legends Associated with Holi</h3>

    <h4>Prahlada and Holika</h4>
    <p>
      The most well-known legend behind Holi is the story of Prahlada,
      a devoted follower of Lord Vishnu.
      His father, King Hiranyakashipu, tried to punish him for his devotion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Holika, Prahlada’s aunt, attempted to burn him in a fire,
      but divine grace saved Prahlada while Holika was destroyed.
      This story represents the eternal victory of good over evil.
    </p>

    <h4>Radha and Krishna</h4>
    <p>
      In the Braj region, Holi celebrates the playful and divine love
      of Radha and Krishna.
      According to legend, Krishna playfully coloured Radha’s face,
      beginning the tradition of playing with colours.
    </p>

    <h4>Kama and Rati</h4>
    <p>
      In Shaivite traditions, Holi is linked to the legend of Kamadeva,
      the god of love, who was burned by Lord Shiva and later revived.
      This legend symbolizes rebirth, love, and emotional renewal.
