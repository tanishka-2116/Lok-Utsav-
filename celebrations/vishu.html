  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Vishu is the traditional New Year festival
      of <strong>Kerala</strong>,
      celebrated in mid-April
      when the Sun enters the zodiac sign of Aries (Mesha).
      The word <strong>“Vishu”</strong>
      comes from Sanskrit and means
      <em>“equal”</em>,
      symbolising balance, harmony, and renewal.
    </p>

    <p>
      Vishu marks the beginning of a new agricultural cycle
      and is deeply connected to prosperity,
      gratitude, and positive vision for the year ahead.

  <section>
    <h3>Vishukkani – The Auspicious First Sight</h3>

    <p>
      The most important ritual of Vishu
      is <strong>Vishukkani</strong>,
      which literally means
      <em>“the first thing seen on Vishu morning.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      On the previous night,
      elders prepare a sacred arrangement
      that devotees see immediately upon waking up,
      believing that the first sight of the year
      determines prosperity and fortune.
    </p>

    <h4>Items in Vishukkani</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Lord Krishna idol or image</li>
      <li>Golden yellow Konna flowers</li>
      <li>Rice, fruits, and vegetables</li>
      <li>Coins and gold ornaments</li>
      <li>Mirror (symbol of self-reflection)</li>
      <li>Traditional oil lamp (Nilavilakku)</li>

  <!-- MYTHOLOGY -->
  <section>
    <h3>Mythological and Cultural Significance</h3>

    <p>
      Vishu is closely associated with
      <strong>Lord Krishna</strong>,
      especially in temples like Guruvayur.
      Krishna represents divine playfulness,
      wisdom, and protection,
      making him central to Vishu worship.
    </p>

    <p>
      The festival also aligns with
      solar movement and seasonal change,
      reflecting ancient Indian knowledge
      of astronomy and agriculture.
