  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Ram Navami is a sacred Hindu festival
      that celebrates the birth of
      <strong>Lord Rama</strong>,
      the seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu.
      He is revered as <strong>Maryada Purushottam</strong>,
      the ideal human being who lived by dharma,
      truth, compassion, and duty.
    </p>

    <p>
      The festival is observed on the
      <strong>ninth day (Navami)</strong>
      of the bright half of the lunar month
      of <em>Chaitra</em>,
      and it marks the culmination of
      <strong>Chaitra Navratri</strong>.

  <!-- STORY -->
  <section>
    <h3>The Birth of Lord Rama</h3>

    <p>
      According to the <strong>Ramayana</strong>,
      King Dasharatha of Ayodhya
      performed the <em>Putrakameshti Yajna</em>
      to obtain heirs.
      As a result of the divine blessing,
      Rama was born to Queen Kaushalya,
      while his brothers
      Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna
      were born to the other queens.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lord Rama was born at noon,
      and this moment is marked by
      special prayers known as
      <strong>Madhyahna Puja</strong>.
    </p>

  <!-- SPIRITUAL MEANING -->
  <section>
    <h3>Spiritual and Philosophical Significance</h3>

    <p>
      Ram Navami is not just a celebration of birth,
      but a reminder of how life should be lived.
      Rama’s life teaches values such as
      obedience to duty,
      respect for elders,
      sacrifice, humility,
      and unwavering commitment to righteousness.
    </p>

    <p>
      He chose exile over breaking a promise,
      forgiveness over revenge,
      and justice over personal comfort —
      making him an eternal moral guide.
