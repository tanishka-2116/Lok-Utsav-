  </section>

  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Bihu is the most important and widely celebrated festival of Assam.
      Unlike many festivals observed once a year, Bihu is celebrated
      <strong>three times annually</strong>,
      each marking a different stage of the agricultural cycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Deeply rooted in nature, farming, and community life,
      Bihu reflects the rhythm of sowing, growing, and harvesting crops.
      It is a celebration of joy, gratitude, hope, and togetherness.
    </p>

  <!-- THREE BIHUS -->
  <section>
    <h3>The Three Types of Bihu</h3>

    <h4>Bohag Bihu (Rongali Bihu)</h4>
    <p>
      Celebrated in mid-April, Bohag Bihu marks the
      <strong>Assamese New Year</strong>
      and the arrival of spring.
      It is the most vibrant and festive of the three.
    </p>

    <p>
      Homes come alive with music, dance, and celebrations.
      Young people perform Bihu dance,
      symbolizing fertility, youth, and the joy of new beginnings.
    </p>

    <h4>Kati Bihu (Kongali Bihu)</h4>
    <p>
      Observed in mid-October, Kati Bihu is a quieter,
      more reflective festival.
      This period coincides with a time when granaries are nearly empty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Earthen lamps are lit in paddy fields and near the Tulsi plant
      to pray for the protection of crops and a good harvest.
      The festival reflects humility, patience, and hope.
    </p>

    <h4>Magh Bihu (Bhogali Bihu)</h4>
    <p>
      Celebrated in mid-January,
      Magh Bihu marks the end of the harvest season
      and coincides with <strong>Makar Sankranti</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a festival of abundance, feasting, and community gatherings,
      celebrating the fruits of hard agricultural labour.
    </p>

  <!-- RITUALS -->
  <section>
    <h3>Key Rituals of Magh Bihu</h3>

    <h4>Meji and Bhelaghar</h4>
    <p>
      On the eve of Magh Bihu, people build temporary huts
      called <strong>Bhelaghar</strong> using bamboo, hay, and leaves.
      Communities gather inside these huts to enjoy a grand feast
      known as the <strong>Uruka feast</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next morning, tall structures called <strong>Meji</strong>
      are burned as offerings to the Fire God,
      symbolizing purification and gratitude.
