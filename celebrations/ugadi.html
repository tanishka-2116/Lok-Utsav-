  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Ugadi is the traditional New Year festival
      celebrated primarily in
      <strong>Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana</strong>.
      The word <strong>“Ugadi”</strong>
      is derived from the Sanskrit words
      <em>“Yuga”</em> (era) and <em>“Adi”</em> (beginning),
      meaning <strong>“the beginning of a new era.”</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Ugadi marks the first day of the
      <strong>Chaitra month</strong>
      according to the Hindu lunisolar calendar.
      It symbolises fresh beginnings,
      hope, renewal, and acceptance of life in all its forms.

  <!-- MYTHOLOGY -->
  <section>
    <h3>Mythological and Historical Significance</h3>

    <p>
      According to Hindu tradition,
      Ugadi is believed to be the day
      when <strong>Lord Brahma</strong>
      began the creation of the universe.
      Hence, it is regarded as the
      <strong>cosmic new year</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The festival is also associated
      with agricultural cycles,
      marking the arrival of spring
      and the beginning of a new farming season.
      It reflects humanity’s deep connection
      with nature and time.

  <!-- SYMBOLISM -->
  <section>
    <h3>The Philosophy Behind Ugadi</h3>

    <p>
      Ugadi carries a profound life lesson:
      <strong>life is a mixture of emotions</strong>.
      This philosophy is beautifully expressed
      through its most iconic dish — Ugadi Pachadi.
    </p>

    <p>
      The festival teaches people to
      welcome the coming year with balance,
      wisdom, gratitude, and acceptance —
      embracing both joy and challenges equally.

  <!-- FOOD -->
  <section>
    <h3>Traditional Food: Ugadi Pachadi</h3>

    <p>
      Ugadi Pachadi is the symbolic dish of Ugadi,
      made using six distinct ingredients,
      each representing a different emotion of life.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Neem flowers:</strong> Bitterness – challenges and hardships</li>
      <li><strong>Jaggery:</strong> Sweetness – happiness and success</li>
      <li><strong>Tamarind:</strong> Sourness – unexpected situations</li>
      <li><strong>Raw mango:</strong> Tanginess – surprises</li>
      <li><strong>Salt:</strong> Salty taste – fear and realism</li>
      <li><strong>Chili:</strong> Spiciness – anger and passion</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This dish reminds people that
      every year will bring a mix of experiences,
      and wisdom lies in accepting all of them gracefully.
