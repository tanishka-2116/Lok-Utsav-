    <h2>Raksha Bandhan</h2>
    <p><em>The Festival of Protection, Love, and Responsibility</em></p>
  </section>

  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Raksha Bandhan is a traditional Indian festival
      that celebrates the sacred bond
      between brothers and sisters.
      The term <strong>“Raksha Bandhan”</strong>
      literally means <em>“the bond of protection.”</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      It is celebrated on the
      <strong>full moon day (Purnima)</strong>
      of the Hindu month of <em>Shravana</em>,
      usually falling in August.
      On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread
      called a <strong>Rakhi</strong>
      on their brothers’ wrists,
      symbolising love, prayers, and trust.
    </p>

    <h3>Historical and Mythological Significance</h3>

    <p>
      Raksha Bandhan is deeply rooted
      in Indian history, epics, and folklore.
      Unlike many festivals,
      it is not limited to one single story,
      but reflects a universal value of protection.
    </p>

        <strong>Draupadi and Krishna:</strong>
        When Draupadi tore her saree
        to bandage Krishna’s finger,
        Krishna vowed to protect her,
        fulfilling this promise during the disrobing episode.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rani Karnavati and Humayun:</strong>
        The Rajput queen sent a Rakhi to the Mughal emperor,
