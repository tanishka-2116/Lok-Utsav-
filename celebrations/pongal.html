      nature, and farm animals for blessing the land with a successful harvest.

  <!-- SIGNIFICANCE -->
  <section>
    <h3>Significance of Pongal</h3>

    <p>
      The word “Pongal” means <strong>“to boil over”</strong>.
      This act symbolizes abundance, prosperity, and overflowing happiness.
      The ritual boiling of rice with milk and jaggery
      represents gratitude for nature’s generosity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pongal coincides with the Sun’s northward journey (<em>Uttarayan</em>),
      aligning it with Makar Sankranti celebrated across other parts of India.
      While the theme of harvest is shared nationwide,
      Pongal reflects the unique cultural spirit of Tamil Nadu.
