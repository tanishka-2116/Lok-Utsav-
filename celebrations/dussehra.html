  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Dussehra, also known as <strong>Vijayadashami</strong>,
      is one of the most important Hindu festivals,
      symbolising the eternal victory of
      <strong>good over evil</strong>.
      It is celebrated on the <strong>tenth day</strong>
      after Navratri, marking the culmination
      of nine nights of devotion and discipline.
    </p>

    <p>
      The festival commemorates two major victories:
      <strong>Lord Rama’s defeat of Ravana</strong>
      and <strong>Goddess Durga’s victory over Mahishasura</strong>.
      Together, these stories reinforce the power of
      righteousness, courage, and moral duty.

  <!-- RAMAYANA STORY -->
  <section>
    <h3>Lord Rama and the Defeat of Ravana</h3>

    <p>
      According to the <strong>Ramayana</strong>,
      Ravana, the ten-headed king of Lanka,
      symbolised ego, arrogance, and misuse of power.
      Lord Rama fought Ravana to rescue Goddess Sita
      and restore dharma.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Vijayadashami,
      Rama defeated Ravana,
      teaching that no matter how powerful evil appears,
      it ultimately collapses before truth and virtue.
      The burning of Ravana’s effigies symbolises
      the destruction of ego, lust, anger, and pride.

  <!-- DURGA CONNECTION -->
  <section>
    <h3>Goddess Durga and Mahishasura</h3>

    <p>
      In eastern India,
      Vijayadashami marks the day
      Goddess Durga defeated the buffalo demon
      <strong>Mahishasura</strong>,
      representing ignorance and oppression.
    </p>

    <p>
      After nine days of battle,
      Durga emerged victorious on the tenth day,
      reinforcing the belief that
      divine feminine energy (Shakti)
      protects cosmic balance.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- SPIRITUAL MEANING -->
  <section>
    <h3>Deeper Spiritual Meaning</h3>

    <p>
      Vijayadashami symbolises
      inner victory —
      conquering one’s own fears,
      ego, and negative tendencies.
      It reminds individuals to
      choose righteousness even
      when the path is difficult.
    </p>

    <p>
      The day is considered highly auspicious
      for new beginnings —
      education, business, art, and spiritual practices.
      In many traditions, children are introduced
      to learning on this day.
