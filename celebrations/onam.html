  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section>
    <p>
      Onam is the <strong>National Festival of Kerala</strong>
      and one of the most significant harvest celebrations in India.
      It is a ten-day festival that honours the legendary,
      kind-hearted King <strong>Mahabali</strong>,
      whose annual homecoming is believed to bless the land with
      prosperity, harmony, and happiness.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2026, Onam will be celebrated from
      <strong>25 August to 4 September</strong>,
      with the most important day,
      <strong>Thiruvonam</strong>, falling on 4 September.

  <!-- LEGEND -->
  <section>
    <h3>The Legend of King Mahabali</h3>

    <p>
      According to legend, King Mahabali was a just and benevolent ruler
      under whose reign Kerala experienced equality, abundance,
      and peace.
      There was no poverty, dishonesty, or discrimination in his kingdom.
    </p>

    <p>
      The gods, threatened by his growing power,
      sent Lord Vishnu in the form of <strong>Vamana</strong>.
      Pleased by Mahabali’s devotion and humility,
      Vishnu granted him a boon —
      Mahabali could visit his people once every year.
    </p>

    <p>
      Onam celebrates this symbolic return of a ruler
      who represents fairness, generosity, and good governance.
